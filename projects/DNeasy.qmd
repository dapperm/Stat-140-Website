## Summary

During tissue transplant, we can apply decellurization techniques to remove cellular components which could trigger an immune reaction to the transplanted tissue. 

This study evaluated the DNA concentration change from natural tissue samples to decellularized samples using a decellularization protocol we found was most optimal in [this study](proteomics.qmd). I used R to create visualizations to better evaluate the DNA concentration data that the lab team collected in this study.
