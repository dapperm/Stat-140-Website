    "text": "Hello! I’m Michael Krikor Gureghian, a senior studying Statistics & Data Science at UCLA. I’m passionate about finding connections in data to establish understanding and insight when it isn’t innately there.\nI have extensive experience working with medical research and biostatistics, but also have practiced some financial analytics and data engineering. This experience has informed a lot of my analytical skillset, and I’m excited to see what future projects will help me learn and grow even more!"
